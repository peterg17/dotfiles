# Pi configuration

This directory contains dotfiles-managed configuration for [`pi`](https://pi.dev), including skills, prompt templates, agents, and extensions.

## Ticket teammate workflow

The ticket workflow is a pi adaptation of the Claude `parallel-tickets` workflow. It uses the `subagent` extension (or the `team-tmux` extension for visual teams) plus specialized teammate agents to handle technical ticket work end-to-end.

Two execution modes:

- **Subagent mode** (headless) — the `ticket-workflow` skill runs sub-pi processes in chains/parallel and returns results inline.
- **Visual team mode** (tmux) — the `team-ticket` and `obsidian-ticket-team` skills spawn labeled tmux panes for each agent (reviewer, tester, implementer-per-ticket) with inter-agent messaging and PR-comment polling. Pi equivalent of [Claude Code Agent Teams](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams).

### Installed resources

- Skills:
  - `pi/skills/ticket-workflow/SKILL.md` — headless subagent orchestration
  - `pi/skills/team-ticket/SKILL.md` — visual tmux team orchestration for Jira/GitHub-style tickets (1–5 tickets, shared reviewer/tester, PR comment polling)
  - `pi/skills/obsidian-ticket-team/SKILL.md` — visual tmux team orchestration for Obsidian Markdown ticket notes
- Extensions/packages:
  - `pi/extensions/subagent/` — spawn isolated sub-pi processes for chained / parallel work
  - `pi/extensions/obsidian-tickets/` — create/update Obsidian ticket notes and generate a Dataview-first Agentic Tasks dashboard with Markdown fallback
  - `git:github.com/peterg17/pi-teams-tmux` — visual agent teams in tmux panes; registers `team_create`, `team_spawn`, `team_send`, `team_status`, `team_watch_pr`, `team_unwatch_pr`, `team_destroy` tools and a teammate `send_message` tool
- Agents:
  - `ticket-jira-analyst` — reads/summarizes Jira tickets
  - `ticket-scout` — investigates relevant code/tests/commands
  - `ticket-planner` — creates implementation plans
  - `ticket-implementer` — edits code and runs focused validation
  - `ticket-reviewer` — reviews diffs without editing
  - `ticket-tester` — runs requested validation commands
  - `ticket-validator` — checks acceptance criteria readiness
- Prompt templates:
  - `/plan-ticket`
  - `/ticket`
  - `/tickets`
  - `/review-ticket`

After changing these files, run `/reload` inside pi.

### Common usage

Plan a ticket without editing:

```text
/plan-ticket PROJ-123
```

Work a single ticket end-to-end:

```text
/ticket PROJ-123
```

By default this:

1. Reads the Jira ticket.
2. Runs the teammate planning chain: analyst → scout → planner.
3. Asks before editing unless you explicitly requested autonomous execution.
4. Runs implementation.
5. Runs reviewer, tester, and validator gates.
6. Does not commit, push, or open a PR unless explicitly asked.

Work multiple independent tickets:

```text
/tickets PROJ-123 PROJ-456
```

This is intended for 2–5 independent tickets. It follows a worktree-based flow so each ticket can be implemented independently.

Review the current diff against a ticket:

```text
/review-ticket PROJ-123
```

Spawn a visual tmux team for a ticket:

```text
spawn a team for PROJ-123
```

or explicitly:

```text
/skill:team-ticket PROJ-123
```

Multiple tickets in parallel with a visual team:

```text
/skill:team-ticket PROJ-123 PROJ-456 PROJ-789
```

Spawn a visual team from an Obsidian ticket note:

```text
/skill:obsidian-ticket-team [[My Obsidian Ticket]]
```

Generated Obsidian tickets include this instruction under `## Agent Instructions`.

### Commit / PR behavior

The workflow will not commit, push, or create PRs unless you explicitly ask, e.g.:

```text
/ticket PROJ-123 proceed autonomously and open a draft PR if validation passes
```

When creating PRs, the workflow is instructed to:

- stage specific files only
- use conventional commits
- preserve project-required AI footers from AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md
- use `git push -u origin <branch>` for new worktree branches
- create draft PRs with `gh pr create --draft`

### Jira workflow bias

The `ticket-workflow` and `team-ticket` skills are intentionally biased toward Peter's typical Jira-based workflow:

- uses `jira issue view <KEY> --plain` when possible
- respects AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md for repo conventions
- assumes Java/Gradle/Spotless conventions when applicable
- delegates project-specific ticket creation to any installed per-project ticket-creation skill

Use `obsidian-ticket-team` when the work item is an Obsidian Markdown ticket note instead of a Jira/GitHub-style ticket key.

### Troubleshooting

If pi does not show the new commands or skill:

```text
/reload
```

If you see skill frontmatter errors, check YAML quoting in `pi/skills/ticket-workflow/SKILL.md`.

If the `subagent` tool is unavailable, verify these symlinks exist after running `./install`:

```sh
ls ~/.pi/agent/extensions/subagent/index.ts
ls ~/.pi/agent/agents/ticket-planner.md
ls ~/.pi/agent/skills/ticket-workflow/SKILL.md
```

### Obsidian ticket dashboard

The `obsidian-tickets` extension is installed from `pi/extensions/obsidian-tickets/index.ts`. It keeps ticket frontmatter as the source of truth and regenerates `00 Maps/Agentic Tasks.md` with Dataview sections for status, priority, project/epic, and recently updated tickets. A plain Markdown fallback is included in the generated dashboard for vaults without Dataview enabled.

Recommended setup:

1. Enable the Obsidian Dataview community plugin.
2. Configure the vault path with `OBSIDIAN_TICKETS_VAULT` if your vault is not at the default `~/Documents/notes`.
3. Optionally configure `OBSIDIAN_TICKETS_DIR`, `OBSIDIAN_TICKETS_SCAN_DIRS`, and `OBSIDIAN_TICKETS_DASHBOARD` before launching pi.
4. Run `/tickets-rebuild --dry-run`, then `/tickets-rebuild` to backfill existing `type: ticket` notes and untyped legacy notes in the configured ticket folders.

Kanban plugin sync is deferred; use the generated Dataview dashboard as the canonical board view for now.

When tickets are created in folders outside `OBSIDIAN_TICKETS_SCAN_DIRS`, the extension records those additional scan roots in the generated dashboard frontmatter (`ticket-scan-dirs`) so they remain tracked after `/reload` or a pi restart.

If the `team_create` tool is unavailable, verify the `pi-team-tmux` package and team skills:

```sh
pi list
ls ~/.pi/agent/skills/team-ticket/SKILL.md
ls ~/.pi/agent/skills/obsidian-ticket-team/SKILL.md
```

If the package is missing, run the dotfiles installer or install it manually:

```sh
pi install git:github.com/peterg17/pi-teams-tmux
```

The `pi-team-tmux` package also requires `tmux` 3.2+ and the `gh` CLI (the latter is only needed for `team_watch_pr`).
